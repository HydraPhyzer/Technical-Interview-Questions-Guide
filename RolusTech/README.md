# Application Process
1. Resume Screening 
2. Online/Onsite test on Gorilla platform.
3. Two technical interviews.
4. Final Interview with VP. 

# Tips for Prepararation
1. The Gorilla test MCQs mostly consists of analytical (riddle type, pattern finding), theoretical (OS,DB), 2 Coding Questions and 1 Detailed SQL query.
2. My advice is prepare for SQL question, it is a detailed question and you should know about concepts like (Groupby, Orderby, Subquery etc).
3. In technical interviews other than technical questions they will also ask questions regarding daily technologies you interact with like (Whatsapp, Google Maps etc) just to check your awareness. 
4. In the VP interview he will not ask any technical questions, he will be checking your personality and would be confusing you in every question just don't lose confidence in this interview.
