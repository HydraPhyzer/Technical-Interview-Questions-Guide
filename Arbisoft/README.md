# Arbisoft Hiring Process
1. Online MCQ test
2. On-site 8 hours long Job sample test

4. HR interview

# If you have more than 2 weeks to prepare
- practice coding in Python

- get familiar with API fetching and cleaning data ( see 2023 API question and solution for reference , how to deal with json etc)
- study how to design using OOP
- practice leetcode questions

# Tips
1. Complete the practice test available on Arbisoft’s website.  
[Practice Test](https://freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com/past-results.html)
2. There will be one question about API, practice that in your preferred language.
3. 50% is for the correct code (passing test cases), other 50% weightage is for clean and efficient code.
4. Try to do the Job sample test in Python, I think, it will save a lot of time.
5. The job sample test is 8 hours long so take your time, and don’t rush things.
6. Most students don’t know how to read command line arguments, see how to do that beforehand.
7. Don’t overcomplicate the class design problem.
